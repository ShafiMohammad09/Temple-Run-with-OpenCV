# Project: Active Temple Run: Move to Play

### Project Abstract
Active Temple Run: Move to Play is an interactive version of the popular game Temple Run that incorporates physical movements to control the game, thereby reducing screen time and promoting physical activity among children and adults.

### Aim
The aim of this project is to create an interactive version of the popular game Temple Run that incorporates physical movements to control the game, thereby reducing screen time and promoting physical activity among children and adults.

### Motive
The primary motive behind this project is to address the mental and physical health concerns associated with prolonged screen time. By integrating body movements into the gameplay, this project encourages players to engage in physical activities, making the gaming experience both fun and beneficial for their health.

### Overview
This project leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and classify body poses using a webcam. The game is controlled through various physical movements such as jumping, crouching, and moving left or right. The key technologies used in this project include OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for pose detection, and PyAutoGUI for simulating keyboard inputs based on detected poses. The overall goal is to create an engaging and healthy gaming experience that promotes physical exercise while playing Temple Run.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For image processing
- **MediaPipe**: For pose detection
- **PyAutoGUI**: For simulating keyboard inputs
